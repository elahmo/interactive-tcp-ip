Interactive presentation about the DOD Internet Model, in layers. Check out the working version at the following link: http://elahmo.github.io/interactive-tcp-ip

## How to use?

After loading the [url](http://elahmo.github.io/interactive-tcp-ip), click on any layer to start the presentation. Some key points are noted, and for each layer the corresponding elements that are represented on that layer can be dragged and dropped to the 'hot area' in order to interactively build up the package. Once all the elements that are supposed to be added at a layer are added, the presentation will go to the next layer, or to the layer beneath it.
